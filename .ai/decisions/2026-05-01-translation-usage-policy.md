## Context

This repo uses translation primitives in templates. Feature-specific JSON translation maps and code-side localization helpers add a second translation path that is harder to maintain and easy to leave stale.

## Decision

Use `TranslateDirective` and `TranslateService` as the default translation mechanism for UI copy in this repository.

Do not use `TranslatePipe`; it is no longer available in the current `@wawjs/ngx-translate` package.

In templates, pass real source text to translation primitives instead of generated translation keys. For example, prefer `<span [translate]="dish.name">{{ dish.name }}</span>` over helper-driven keys such as `<span [translate]="dishNameKey(dish.slug)">{{ dish.name }}</span>`.

Do not introduce or preserve:

- feature-specific `*.translations.json` files
- code-side translation maps for page or feature text
- localization helpers that rewrite API or fallback content into generated translation keys before rendering unless a task explicitly requires that behavior

## Consequences

- translation usage stays visible in templates
- agents should remove dead translation helper files when the template-based path replaces them
- content and fallback data should stay as plain source data rather than duplicated localized maps

## Alternatives Considered

Feature-level JSON translation files were rejected because they duplicate template translation responsibilities and create avoidable maintenance drift.
