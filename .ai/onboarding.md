# Onboarding Guide

Use this file after `AGENTS.md` when you need quick orientation before touching product code.

## First Things To Understand

- there is only one website in this repo
- the repo-level defaults live in `AGENTS.md`
- most tasks affect a marketing page, not application infrastructure
- users need quick access to menu, hours, address, phone, delivery, reservation, and important offers

## What To Inspect Before Editing

- the nearest existing page
- shared layout pieces such as header, footer, topbar, hero, CTA, contact section
- existing route structure
- current styling approach with Tailwind and local SCSS
- current SEO/meta setup if the task affects page content or structure
- `.ai/custom-gpt.md` if the task affects Custom GPT prompt generation for this template
- `.ai/custom-gpt.md` and `.ai/custom-gpt/*.md` whenever template behavior changes in a way future business-adaptation prompts should mention

## What To Avoid

- do not restate repo-wide policy in task-specific notes
- do not overengineer static sections
- do not hide important business information inside images only
- do not add heavy motion, sliders, or effects unless requested
