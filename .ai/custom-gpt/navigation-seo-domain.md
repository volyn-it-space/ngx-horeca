## Navigation And Layout

The header logo or business name must always link to the landing page route `/`.
Do not repurpose that click target.

The footer/bottom navigation is the compact primary navigation surface:
- first footer item stays `/navigation`
- the footer should contain `/navigation` plus four high-priority page links
- all other relevant pages should be reachable from the Navigation page
- if replacing a footer item, move the displaced still-relevant page link to the Navigation page
- if removing a page/feature that was in the footer, promote the most important remaining
  Navigation page item into the footer
- if a feature/page is removed entirely, remove its footer and Navigation page links together
- protected feature/page groups from `feature-page-map.md` should remain discoverable from the
  Navigation page even when they are not high-priority enough for the footer
- when pruning an individual entry from a protected group, remove only links to that pruned entry,
  not the whole feature's list page link unless the user explicitly asks

Footer labels should remain short enough for the mobile layout.

## Company Data

The `company` feature handles most website identity:
- `src/data/company.json`
- `src/app/feature/company/company.data.ts`
- `src/app/feature/company/company.interface.ts`
- `src/app/feature/company/company.service.ts`

Tell the coding agent to update company data before duplicating business identity across pages.
Core values include business name, language/locale, site URL, logo, phone, email, address,
default SEO, page SEO, structured data, cuisine/service type, locality, country, and social links.

## Static Metadata

`src/index.html` is a static shell and is not fully derived from the company feature.
When adapting the template to a real business, tell the coding agent to update:
- `<html lang>`
- `<title>`
- meta description, keywords, author, robots
- itemprop name, description, image
- Open Graph type, site name, locale, URL, title, description, image
- Twitter card, title, description, image
- canonical link
- favicon/logo references if the asset changes
- theme color only when relevant to the redesign/theme

## Domain And CNAME

The target domain must be applied consistently:
- `src/data/company.json` `siteUrl`
- static canonical URL
- Open Graph URL
- any absolute structured-data/site URLs
- root `CNAME`

`CNAME` must contain the bare domain only, without protocol or path.

Examples:
- correct: `restaurant.example.com`
- incorrect: `https://restaurant.example.com`
- incorrect: `restaurant.example.com/`
